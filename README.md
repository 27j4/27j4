# 👋 Hi, I'm Anshul Pandey

**Software Development Intern @ Zeta (Directi)**  
**ICPC Regionalist | Competitive Programmer | Backend-Focused Engineer**

I am a final-year Computer Science undergraduate at **IET Lucknow**, deeply interested in **backend engineering**, **scalable systems**, and **problem-solving at scale**.  
Currently, I am training and working at **Zeta (Directi)**, where I am building enterprise-grade applications while strengthening my foundations in clean architecture and software design.

I enjoy working close to the system level — writing clean, maintainable code, understanding how things work under the hood, and solving challenging algorithmic problems.
